A Python based os

This has been my dream, to make an OS, and now, its happening. Please, feel free to commit in any way you can!
NOTE: This is for fun. it was designed for me to learn code, and to create something out of this. But, if you really want to, you could boot it into an actual computer. feel free to edit it and make it practical.
This is the game branch
